# Code Challenge: Class 39 /Mock Interviews :

## Challenge

### Given a graph, are 2 given nodes connected?.

* ### The candidate should write a function that accepts as input two nodes and a graph, represented as an adjacency list.
* ### The format of the adjacency list can be specified by the candidate.
* ### The function should traverse the graph, using any traversal method.
* ### The traversal should start at one node, and continue until the second node is found, or the traversal is completed.
* ### The return type of this method will be boolean.

## Approach

* ### I understood the problem first
* ### I imagined how the results should be
* ### I made a drawings of how the hashTable would be after insertion of multiple key and values.
* ### I wrote the code
* ### I made the tests

## Efficiency

* ### time : O(n) 
* ### space : O(n)
