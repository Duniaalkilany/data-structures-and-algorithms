# Code Challenge: Class 38 /Graph-depth-first:

## Challenge


### Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach

* ### I understood the problem first
* ### I imagined how the results should be
* ### I made a drawings of how the hashTable would be after insertion of multiple key and values.
* ### I wrote the code
* ### I made the tests

## Efficiency

* ### time : O(n^2) 
* ### space : O(n) 


## API

* ### dfs(startNode): 

  * #### Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
  * #### Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
