# Code Challenge: Class 36 /  Graph-breadth-first:



## Challenge

### Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.
### Write the following method for the Graph class:

* ### breadth first
* ### Arguments: Node
* ### Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
* ### Display the collection

## Approach

* ### I understood the problem first
* ### I imagined how the results should be
* ### I made a drawings of how the hashTable would be after insertion of multiple key and values.
* ### I wrote the code
* ### I made the tests

## Efficiency

* ### time : O(n^2) 
* ### space : O(n) 


## API

* ### add node : Arguments: value Returns: The added node Add a node to the graph


* ### add edge : Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional) Returns: nothing Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph ,If specified, assign a weight to the edge ,Both nodes should already be in the Graph


* ### get nodes : Arguments: none Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)


* ### get neighbors : Arguments: node Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node,Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection


* ### size : Arguments: none Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

* ### breadth first : 

  * #### Arguments: Node ,

  * #### Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited,

 * #### Display the collection
